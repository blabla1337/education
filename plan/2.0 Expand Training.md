## 2.3 Expand current 'Lab' offerings that correlate to the currently indexed Security Knowledge Graph (SKG) 'Standards'
#### Explanation: Expand current 'Labs' offerings to complete SKF's coverage with the currently indexed standards (e.g., ASVS & WSTG) in the Security Knowledge Graph (SKG).

In the Security Knowledge Framework (SKF), we define a 'Lab' as an isolated web application environment demonstrating a specific Security vulnerability / concept. Each 'Lab' also details how to exploit and fix the said vulnerability / concept in an accompanying 'Write-up' markdown file. Each 'Write-up' should be authored in accordance to the SKF 'Lab/Write-up Style Guide'.
